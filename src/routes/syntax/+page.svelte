  <title>Query syntax - neogrok</title>
</svelte:head>

<div class="space-y-2">
  <h1 class="text-2xl text-center">Query syntax</h1>
  <p>
    The query syntax of neogrok is controlled by
    <Link to="https://github.com/sourcegraph/zoekt">zoekt</Link>, the code
    search engine for which neogrok is a frontend. Because zoekt does not have
    good documentation covering this syntax, we describe it here.
  </p>
  <section class="space-y-2">
    <Heading id="regex">Everything is regex</Heading>
    <p>
      In zoekt, all queries are parsed by Go&apos;s regexp package, the syntax
      of which is documented
      <Link to="https://pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax#hdr-Syntax">here</Link>. There
      is no way to disable this functionality; queries that want to use regex
      control characters literally must escape them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Queries cannot control the
      <Link to="https://pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax#Flags">regex flags</Link>
      that zoekt uses; they are hardcoded. As can be seen
      <Link
        to="https://github.com/sourcegraph/zoekt/blob/58cf4748830ac0eded1517cc8c2454694c531fbd/query/parse.go#L231"
      >
        here,
      </Link> the flags are <code>ClassNL</code>, <code>PerlX</code>, and
      <code>UnicodeGroups</code>. Together, these flags notably allow multiline
      regex matches using character classes like
      <code>[[:space:]]</code>, but <em>not</em> using the dot.
    </p>

  <section class="space-y-2">
    <Heading id="expressions">
      Queries are composed of one or more space-separated expressions
    </Heading>
    <p>
      If your query contains no spaces, its behavior is pretty intuitive.
      <ExampleQuery query="foo" /> displays all matches for the regex
      <Expression>/foo/</Expression>. That query contains a single
      <em>expression</em>, namely a <em>regex</em> expression. (We&apos;ll introduce
      more kinds of expressions below.)
    </p>
    <p>
      But what about <ExampleQuery query="foo bar" />? This query has two
      expressions, which makes its behavior more complicated: it returns all
      matches for the regex <Expression>/foo/</Expression> <em>or</em> the regex <Expression
        >/bar/</Expression
      >, but only in files that have matches for both <Expression
        >/foo/</Expression
      > <em>and</em>
      <Expression>/bar/</Expression>.
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all, if you wanted this query to behave as if it had only one
      expression, literally matching <Expression>/foo bar/</Expression>, you can
      either wrap it in double quotes, like
      <ExampleQuery query={'"foo bar"'} />, or by escaping the space, like
      <ExampleQuery query="foo\ bar" />; both of those queries are equivalent.
      (Single quotes have no special meaning in this regard.
      <ExampleQuery query="'foo bar'" /> contains two expressions, the first being
      <Expression>/&apos;foo/</Expression> and the second being
      <Expression>/bar&apos;/</Expression>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      As described above, expressions are <em>conjunctive</em> by default. A
      file must have at least one match for each expression to be included in
      the query results. Expressions may be made <em>disjunctive</em> by joining
      them with the special expression infix operator
      <code>or</code>. <ExampleQuery query="foo or bar" /> returns all matches for
      <Expression>/foo/</Expression> or
      <Expression>/bar/</Expression> in all files that have matches for least one
      of <Expression>/foo/</Expression> <em>or</em>
      <Expression>/bar/</Expression>. (To use <code>or</code> as a literal
      expression and not as an operator, double quote it:
      <ExampleQuery query={'foo "or" bar'} /> has three conjunctive expressions.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Expressions can be logically grouped with parentheses:
      <ExampleQuery query="foo (bar or baz)" /> produces results from files with
      matches for both <Expression>/foo/</Expression> and at least one of <Expression
        >/bar/</Expression
      > or
      <Expression>/baz/</Expression>. These groupings can be nested arbitrarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      To complete the boolean logic, expressions can be negated with a leading
      dash. <ExampleQuery query="foo -bar" /> returns all matches for <Expression
        >/foo/</Expression
      > in files that do not have matches for <Expression>/bar/</Expression>.
      <ExampleQuery query="foo -(bar or baz)" /> returns all matches for
      <Expression>/foo/</Expression> in files that do not have matches for either
      <Expression>/bar/</Expression> or
      <Expression>/baz/</Expression>.
      <ExampleQuery query="foo -(bar baz)" /> returns all matches for
      <Expression>/foo/</Expression> in files that do not have matches for
      <em>both</em>
      <Expression>/bar/</Expression> and
      <Expression>/baz/</Expression>.

    <Heading id="prefix-expressions">
      Certain prefixes have special effects on expressions
    </Heading>
    <p>
      In addition to the default regex expressions you&apos;ve already seen,
      special kinds of expressions can be created by prefixing them with certain
      flags, which are themselves composed of a few characters ending with a
      colon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider that regex expressions can produce matches both in the content of
      a file and in the <em>name</em> of the file:
      <ExampleQuery query="README" /> matches both file names and file contents (though
      the search engine tends to rank files containing file name matches higher than
      those containing only content matches, so you may have to scroll down or increase
      the number of files displayed to see the content matches for this query). If
      you only want the expression to match file names, use an expression prefixed
      with
      <code>file:</code>, like <ExampleQuery query="file:README" />. (
      <code>f:</code> is an equivalent abbreviation for <code>file:</code>).
    </p>
    <p>
      The inverse of <code>file:</code>&apos;s specialization of regex
      expressions is <code>content:</code> or <code>c:</code>.
      <ExampleQuery query="content:README" /> produces only matches that occur in
      the content of files.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a few more kinds of prefix expressions than those two.
      They&apos;re all tabulated here:
